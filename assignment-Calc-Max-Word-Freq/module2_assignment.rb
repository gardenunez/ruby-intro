#  Implement a class called Solution. 
class Solution

  # Implement the following read-only attributes in the Solution class.
  #* analyzers - an array of LineAnalyzer objects for each line in the file
  #* highest_count_across_lines - a number with the maximum value for highest_wf_words attribute in the analyzers array.
  #* highest_count_words_across_lines - a filtered array of LineAnalyzer objects with the highest_wf_words attribute 
  #  equal to the highest_count_across_lines determined previously.

  # Implement the following methods in the Solution class.
  #* analyze_file() - processes 'test.txt' intro an array of LineAnalyzers and stores them in analyzers.
  #* calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines the highest_count_across_lines and 
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines attribute values
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the values of LineAnalyzer objects in 
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines in the specified format
  
  # Implement the analyze_file() method() to:
  #* Read the 'test.txt' file in lines 
  #* Create an array of LineAnalyzers for each line in the file

  # Implement the calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() method to:
  #* calculate the maximum value for highest_wf_count contained by the LineAnalyzer objects in analyzers array
  #  and stores this result in the highest_count_across_lines attribute.
  #* identifies the LineAnalyzer objects in the analyzers array that have highest_wf_count equal to highest_count_across_lines 
  #  attribute value determined previously and stores them in highest_count_words_across_lines.

  #Implement the print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() method to
  #* print the values of objects in highest_count_words_across_lines in the specified format
